# Weather Getter iOS App

## Overview
The Weather Getter iOS app is a simple weather application designed for academic purposes to showcase the implementation of Core Location for obtaining the user's current location's weather and the ability to search for weather information by specifying the name of a city. It utilizes the Open Weather API to retrieve weather data and demonstrates knowledge in parsing JSON, working with APIs, and other iOS development techniques.
